# Car-Rental-System
A car rental system implemented in Java using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts typically involves creating classes to represent various entities such as cars, customers, rentals, and the rental agency itself. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Car Class**: This class represents individual cars available for rent. It contains attributes such as make, model, year, license plate, rental status, and rental rate.

2. **Customer Class**: This class represents customers who rent cars. It contains attributes such as customer ID, name, contact information, and possibly a rental history.

3. **Rental Class**: This class represents a rental transaction between a customer and a car. It includes attributes such as rental ID, rental duration, rental date, return date, associated car, and customer.

4. **Rental Agency Class**: This class acts as the main controller for the rental system. It manages the inventory of available cars, handles rental requests, processes returns, calculates rental charges, maintains customer records, and generates rental reports.

Key OOP concepts utilized in this system include:

- **Encapsulation**: Classes encapsulate related data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into coherent objects. For example, the Car class encapsulates details about individual cars, while the Rental class encapsulates rental transaction details.

- **Inheritance**: You might use inheritance to represent specialized types of cars, such as economy cars, luxury cars, or SUVs, which inherit common attributes and behaviors from a base Car class.

- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface. For instance, a rental process method in the RentalAgency class can accept any object that implements a Rentable interface, allowing it to handle different types of rental items (e.g., cars, bikes) seamlessly.

- **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and providing a simplified interface for interacting with objects. For example, the RentalAgency class abstracts away the complexities of managing the rental system by providing high-level methods for tasks such as renting a car or processing returns.

By leveraging these OOP principles, the car rental system can be designed to be modular, extensible, and easier to maintain and understand.
